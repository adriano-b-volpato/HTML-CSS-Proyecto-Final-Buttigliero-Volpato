                <p>Revival is the ninth studio album by American rapper Eminem. The album was released on December 15, 2017, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records and Interscope Records.[5] Production for the album took place during 2016 to 2017 at various recording studios. In addition to Eminem himself, music production was handled by various record producers, including Rick Rubin, Fredwreck, Skylar Grey, Alex da Kid, and executive producer Dr. Dre.[6] Revival features guest appearances from artists Beyoncé, Phresher, Ed Sheeran, Alicia Keys, X Ambassadors, Skylar Grey, Kehlani, and Pink.
                    <br>
                    Reception to Revival was mixed, with critics divided over its rock-influenced production on several songs and the heavy use of pop artists for guest appearances. </p>

             <div class="album-description kamikaze">
                <p>Kamikaze (stylized as KAMIKAZƎ) is the tenth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on August 31, 2018, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. The album was released with no prior announcement. It features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon from the band Bon Iver. Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and Dr. Dre served as executive producers, while production was handled by Eminem himself alongside a variety of producers such as Boi-1da, Tay Keith, Ronny J, Mike Will Made It, frequent collaborator Luis Resto, and others.<br>
                    Kamikaze received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised it as an improvement over the rapper's previous album and a welcome return to his more aggressive style, while others criticized Eminem for focusing too much on the reception of Revival throughout the album, and for his lack of adaption to the current sound of hip hop. The album also generated some controversy for its diss tracks against various artists.</p>

            <p>Music to Be Murdered By is the eleventh studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on January 17, 2020, through Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. Just like Eminem’s previous studio album Kamikaze (2018), the album was released with no prior announcement. The album was produced by many producers, with Eminem and Dr. Dre serving as executive producers. It features guest appearances from Skylar Grey, Young M.A, Royce da 5'9", White Gold, Ed Sheeran, the late Juice WRLD, Black Thought, Q-Tip, Denaun, Anderson .Paak, Don Toliver, Kxng Crooked and Joell Ortiz. The album's title, cover art, and concept are inspired by Alfred Hitchcock and Jeff Alexander's 1958 spoken word album Alfred Hitchcock Presents Music to Be Murdered By. The album was supported by three singles: "Darkness", "Godzilla" and "Those Kinda Nights". Alongside the album's surprise release, Eminem also released the music video for "Darkness", which revolves around the 2017 Las Vegas shooting from the point of view of the perpetrator Stephen Paddock alternating with Eminem's own.</p>
